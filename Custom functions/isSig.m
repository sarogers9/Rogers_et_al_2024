function changedCells = isSig(traces,baselineTime,targetTime)
%this function checks whether cells are significantly modulated by certain
%   stimuli
% INPUT:    traces  - cell traces over trial of interest
%           baselineTime - array of times considered baseline
%           targetTime - array of times of interest
% OUTPUT:   changedCells - cell containing cells that are up, down, and not
%           regulated during target time
