* columns are components for a model of rank 5. if t is number of time samples per trial, c is cell, and T is trials, first row is empty, and using Matlab indexing, rows 2:t+1 are temporal factor weights for each time, t+2:t+c+1 are neuron factor weights for each neuron, and t+c+2:t+c+T+1 are trial factor weights for each trial
* used in code sections 8-12
### 6. Threshold testing
* fake tensor of 1 simulated neuron, with identical within and across trial structure as real data. `placeboMat2.mat`
* average neuron factor weights from 100 iterations of TCA on the placebo tensor for x neurons, where x is the number of neurons for each animal, yielding a null hypothesis threshold for each animal. animals (rows) 1-14 are psilocybin, 15-21 are saline. `fMeans.csv`
* created in TCA code written by [Williams et al. 2018](https://github.com/neurostatslab/tensortools)

## In Vivo Imaging Analysis Pipeline for Rogers et al., 2024, Longitudinal Analysis Pipeline 
Each part depends on previous parts and will not run without one another unless specified. Custom function and data folders must be downloaded and added to path. For the analysis in Fig. 3 and Supp. Fig. 2, please see the fil Rogers_et_al_2024_Figs_3_2S.m. In the following sections you will:
### 1. Load the data of all animals in a given experimental group
* Data: Behavior, dFoF, Cell pooled, session concatenated activity matrices
### 2. Extract the traces of longitudinally registered cells from all files, align to user-defined stimulus times or times of interest
* create tensors for [tensortools](https://github.com/neurostatslab/tensortools)
* downsample (from 20 to 15Hz) calcium data for freezing decoding in Code section 7
* create concatenated activity matrices in Data section 4
#### 3. Plot spatial coordinates of longitudinally registered cells
#### 4. Extract and plot average traces in terms of % baseline of all neurons  averaged over all trials in each session
#### 5. Identify cells that are upregulated or downregulated in response to stimuli in a given session according to their average trace
#### 6. Measure the number of sessions cells tend to maintain stimulus responsiveness
#### 7. Calculate freezing encoding in each neuron in each session and compare within animals across groups
#### 8. Load & plot TCA models, identifying session-dominant components and correlate to freezing
#### 9. Calculate and plot normalized trial factors.
#### 10. Calculate and plot normalized temporal factors.
#### 11. Assess cumulative distribution of neuron weights
#### 12. Identify Acq-Dominant, Ext1-Dominant, and Ext3-Dominant ensembles and their overlaps
* if recreating primary analysis, set threshTest to 0
* if recreating supplement with custom null hypothesis neuron factors (supp fig 6) set threshTest to 1
#### 13. Use a Fisher linear decoder to predict group based on average activity (z-score relative to Acquisition) of each ensemble over time
#### 14. Extract average activity (z-score relative to Acquisition) of each cell in the ensemble during Extinction 1, Extinction 3
* if recreating primary analysis, set threshTest to 0
* if recreating supplement with custom null hypothesis neuron factors (supp fig 6) set threshTest to 1 and uncomment bottom section of code
#### 15. Plot example traces from specific ensembles.
#### 16. Plot average dFoF of non-intersecting Acq-dominant and Ext1/3-dominant ensembles and their ratios over seconds, trials
